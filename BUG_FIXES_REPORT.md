# Bug Fixes Report

## Summary
Found and fixed 3 critical bugs in the design patterns implementation codebase:
1. Security vulnerability due to missing default case in factory pattern
2. Design pattern violation in proxy implementation 
3. Logic error in flyweight pattern cache strategy

## Bug #1: Missing Default Case in Switch Statement

**Category:** Security Vulnerability / Logic Error  
**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `src/main/java/org/designpatterns/creational/factory/NotificationFactory.java`

### Description
The `createNotification` method's switch statement lacked a default case, creating multiple security and reliability issues:

- **Null Pointer Risk:** Passing `null` would cause a `NullPointerException`
- **Future Extension Risk:** Adding new enum values without updating this method would cause runtime failures
- **Defensive Programming Violation:** No validation of input parameters

### Original Code
```java
public Notification createNotification(NotificationType notificationType) {
    return switch (notificationType) {
        case SMS -> new SmsNotification();
        case EMAIL -> new EmailNotification();
        case PUSH -> new PushNotification();
    };
}
```

### Fix Applied
- Added null parameter validation with descriptive error message
- Added default case with clear exception for unsupported types
- Improved error handling and debugging capability

### Impact
- **Security:** Prevents NPE attacks and improves input validation
- **Maintainability:** Future enum additions are now handled gracefully
- **Debugging:** Clear error messages help identify issues quickly

## Bug #2: Incorrect Static Field Usage in Proxy Pattern

**Category:** Design Pattern Violation / Concurrency Issue  
**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `src/main/java/org/designpatterns/structural/proxy/model/ExpensiveObjectProxy.java`

### Description
The `expensiveObject` field was incorrectly declared as `static`, fundamentally breaking the proxy pattern:

- **Shared State Issue:** All proxy instances shared the same expensive object
- **Pattern Violation:** Each proxy should manage its own object instance
- **Thread Safety:** Potential race conditions during lazy initialization
- **Unexpected Behavior:** Multiple proxies don't work independently

### Original Code
```java
public class ExpensiveObjectProxy implements ExpensiveObject {
    private static ExpensiveObject expensiveObject;  // WRONG: static field
    // ...
}
```

### Fix Applied
- Removed `static` modifier from `expensiveObject` field
- Each proxy instance now manages its own expensive object
- Restored proper proxy pattern behavior

### Impact
- **Design Integrity:** Proxy pattern now works as intended
- **Thread Safety:** Eliminated shared state concurrency issues
- **Functionality:** Multiple proxy instances work independently
- **Memory Management:** Proper per-instance lazy loading

## Bug #3: Incorrect Cache Key Strategy in Flyweight Pattern

**Category:** Logic Error / Performance Issue  
**Severity:** Medium-High  
**Location:** `src/main/java/org/designpatterns/structural/flyweight/model/TreeFactory.java`

### Description
The flyweight factory used only the `name` as the cache key, despite TreeType objects being created with multiple properties (`name`, `color`, `otherTreeData`):

- **Cache Inconsistency:** Different TreeTypes with same name but different properties returned wrong objects
- **Data Integrity:** Could return TreeType with incorrect color or data
- **Performance Loss:** Flyweight benefits compromised due to incorrect sharing
- **Logic Error:** Cache key didn't match object identity criteria

### Original Code
```java
public static TreeType getTreeType(String name, Color color, String otherTreeData) {
    TreeType type = treeTypes.get(name);  // WRONG: only using name as key
    if (type == null) {
        type = new TreeType(name, color, otherTreeData);
        treeTypes.put(name, type);  // WRONG: key doesn't match object properties
    }
    return type;
}
```

### Fix Applied
- Created composite key using all properties that define TreeType uniqueness
- Added helper method `createCompositeKey()` for maintainable key generation
- Used `Objects.toString()` for null-safe key generation
- Updated both cache lookup and storage to use composite key

### Impact
- **Data Integrity:** Correct TreeType objects returned for given parameters
- **Performance:** Proper flyweight sharing based on complete object identity
- **Functionality:** Cache now works correctly with multiple property combinations
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of key generation logic

---

## Verification

All fixes have been applied and the code should now:
1. Handle null inputs gracefully with clear error messages
2. Properly implement the proxy pattern with per-instance object management
3. Correctly cache flyweight objects based on complete property identity

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Factory Pattern:** Test with null inputs and invalid enum values
2. **Proxy Pattern:** Create multiple proxy instances and verify independent behavior
3. **Flyweight Pattern:** Create TreeTypes with same names but different colors/data and verify distinct caching
